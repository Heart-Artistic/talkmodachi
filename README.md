Make Tomodachi Life's TTS say whatever you want!

This website uses a patched version of Tomodachi Life and a custom build of Citra to make Miis say whatever you want! Try it out at https://talkmodachi.dylanpdx.io/
The tool is currently work in progress, so not a lot is documented here, but I hope to change that in the future!
